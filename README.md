# `printf()` Made Easy
## About
This project aims at implementing the `C` standard library `printf()` function in a way that is more readable and easy to understand, such that one can learn the logic and algorithm and not float or get totally confused at the sight of it. We came up with this project in a bid to make the renowned and dreaded *ALX `printf()` project* easier for as many as will really dedicate their time to doing hard things.

It is important to not that one has to have certain knowledge of `C` programming as prerequisites for these codes to make sense; students of **ALX SE** can relate.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
Try not to be overwhelmed at this point but the concepts that you should have practically learned before attempting the printf project on your own includes:
- Variables
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Loops and nested loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Debugging (finding and fixing errors in programs)
- Pointers, arrays and strings
- Double pointers and function pointers
- Preprocessor directives, macros and ternary operators
- Recursion
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc()`, `free()`)
- Structures (struct and typedef)
- Variadic functions
- The secrets of `printf()`; exactly how it works, what it returns, and some of its rarely used functionalities

Hello! Don't be scared now; if you know 30% - 40% of the things listed above, you're doing well, just move on, give it your very best and have the *grit mindset*

## Technologies
It is important you note that we were not too concerned about certain standard as much as we were concerned about transferring the knowledge, *betty* needed some rest so the *betty coding style* was violated to some extent.

The programs were written on the command line of a Linux distro, Ubuntu 22.04.2, and the source codes were compiled with bare `gcc` (gcc with no options, except `-o` for the output), made to comply with `c99` standard to a large extent.
